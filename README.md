Visualize crime stats for area of Greater Northside Management District

It starts with:

http://data.ohouston.org/dataset/houston-police-department-crime-statistics

type data that Sgt. Morrison as recently as last Friday tells me is going real time.  In the meanwhile the feed to:

http://houston.everyblock.com/?only=crime-reports

seems to be live again after a month on hiatus.

So all of that plus api collection of meta data from social networks but geolocated and though it looks like we can pull meta from Nextdoor

https://northsidevillagewest.nextdoor.com/news_feed/?post=29950752

because their are end points, do they want us to and should we.
